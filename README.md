#### This project has the following Cypress-TR integrations: 

- Add test run 
- Add result status : passed , failed, blocked, retest , untested 
- add attachment to test 
- Close run 

#### What is yet to be done : 
One thing that must be remembered is that `cypress open` works to start a run and end the run by sharing the run_id. 
This doesn't work using the `cypress run` command.

#### Left to do besides above: 
- *Run for all suites in project*
- *Add attachment for only failed tests*
- *Add failed tests context*
